This is a C++ program that implements a simple game using the graphics.h library. The game features a ball rolling down an inclined plane (infinity slope) while avoiding obstacles.
The keyconcept used in this project are Bresenham Algorithm , Flood fill Algorithm , rolling body on an inclined plane physics, DOUBLE BUFFER

## spacebar is uded to jump
